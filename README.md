# Test Your Skills with this Coding Quiz!

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

# Usage

- When the start button is pressed, the first question is presented with all options.
- If the answer is correct, the score goes up by one, and if it's incorrect, 50 seconds should be cut off of seconds left.
- If next is clicked, counted as incorrect
- At the end of the 5 question quiz, user is able to add their initials to a scoreboard of highscores
- I wrote several functions to achieve this, to output the different outcomes like correct answer, incorrect answer, when "next" is clicked, etc.
